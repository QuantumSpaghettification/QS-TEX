# QS-TEX
Combining LaTeX and Script - aimed at scientists.
# How to Use
Steps:
 1. Download the editor.py file.
 2. Run (for linux) `python2.7 editor.py <name of LaTeX file>.tex` which will create a file called temp.tex
 3. Run your usual LaTeX compilling programs on temp.tex
 
(steps 2 and 3 above can be easily combined into a bash script.)
